# Title: Equity and Accessibility in Global Healthcare: A Data Analysis Project 
This Project will be separated into Outcome 1, 2 and 3 (Outcome 2 and 3, WIP)

Outcome 1 : Collect data safely and securely
Identify the data required, and appropriate sources, for the chosen approach

DEFINE THE PROJECT OBJECTIVES :
To clearly define the objectives of the healthcare analysis. It’s important to understand what questions we aim to answer or what insights we want to gain. This will guide us in identifying the specific data requirements.

Reasons for Choosing These Topics
1.	Government Public Health Funding vs. GDP:
a.	Analyzing Trends and Cross-Country Comparisons: This dataset provides information on the percentage of a country's GDP allocated to public health expenditure. By analyzing trends over time or comparing across countries, we can assess the level of public investment in healthcare.
b.	Government Priorities: Changes in this percentage can reflect shifts in government priorities. An increase may indicate a commitment to improving healthcare, while a decrease might suggest budget constraints.

2.	Out of pocket expenditure:
a.	Financial Burden on Individuals:  This dataset highlights the share of healthcare costs covered directly by individuals. By integrating this information with public health expenditure, you can understand the balance between government support and the financial burden placed on citizens.
b.	Affordability of Healthcare: A higher share of out-of-pocket expenditure might indicate challenges in healthcare affordability. It's valuable for assessing how accessible healthcare services are to the general population.

3.	 Hospital beds per 1000 people:
a.	Healthcare Infrastructure Capacity: This dataset provides insights into a country's healthcare infrastructure. A higher number of hospital beds per 1,000 people suggests a more robust healthcare system with greater capacity to handle health crises.
b.	Preparedness for Health Emergencies: During pandemics or other health emergencies, the availability of hospital beds is crucial. This dataset allows us to evaluate a country's preparedness and its ability to handle increased demand for healthcare services.
By combining these datasets, we can perform a holistic analysis of a country's healthcare system. 

DATASET DOCUMENTATION : SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL 3
Introduction: Sustainable Development Goal 3, as outlined by the United Nations, aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at every stage of life. The datasets below contribute to the comprehensive understanding of the global perspective on this goal.
